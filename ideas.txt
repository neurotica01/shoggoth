*I* can give chatgpt a statistical tool to roll "how good" a card should be

have temperature rerolls as a powerup for cards

enemies can have a backstory and personality.

we can use deepseek to generate quips, and even aggro players based on their previous quips using j*******s

.
get an idea for a card. 
look up some examples of cards with similar effects based on the idea. (RAG-ish?)


maybe we CAN use that toolkit
