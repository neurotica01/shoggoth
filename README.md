A game of shoggoth. 

to install...

0) clone the repo using git and `cd` into it or use cursooooor or whatever
1) install `uv` somehow. google it
2) in the base directory, one after the other, `uv venv`, `source .venv/bin/activate`, `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` 
4) you will need an `OPENAI_API_KEY` and an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the respective developer portals. toss 5 buckaroos in each
5) you'll want to add those 
6) should be all set. `python3 ./src/shoggoth` (takes a couple seconds to start up initially). Use the up and down arrow keys + enter to navigate.
